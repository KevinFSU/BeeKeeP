Ever wondered why some people put rectangular 'slaps' on their car windows?<br/>We at beekeep feel these stickers don't have a place on a clean car.<br/>
Rectangular slaps are ugly. <br/>
Bottom line.<br/>
We're not reinventing the wheel-- but the bumper sticker. <br/>
If you have any suggestions, comments, design ideas, questions, <br/>
